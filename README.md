# The Impact of Image Data Quality in Deep Learning
Investigates how image data quality impacts deep learning model performance using MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10. Tests MobileNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet under controlled noise to assess robustness and generalization.

This project explores the impact of noisy data on image classification models using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. It trains clean and noisy versions of models (CNN, MobileNet) and evaluates their performance. Key steps include data loading, noise injection, model training, and visualization of results. The notebook demonstrates robustness comparisons and accuracy metrics. Ideal for understanding how noise affects deep learning models.

Features:

Noise injection into datasets.

Training and evaluation of CNN and MobileNet.

Performance comparison between clean and noisy models.

Visualizations of predictions and noise effects.

Dependencies: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib.
